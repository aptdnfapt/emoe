plans for new changes afer beta6 

1. add multi channel setup as default what i mean by that is for now only one channel can be set default for the chat . but i want more than one because to set / use the bot in more than one server . 
2. rn the proj recommends to use docker . but i want you to add a guide to make it usable on a simple ubunut 22.04 system . it shouldnt be hard right ?1st install ollama on local system and pull the model .  changing the .env to use local ollama ip and not ollama container . then install the pkgs for bot like discord.py and shit . an then just run the python bot on a tmux or something
